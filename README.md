# `greeklang` is moving!

I'm migrating my work on code libraries for working with ancient Greek to Scala, and cross-compiling for both the JVM and javascript engines.  I won't be deleting this repository any time soon, but am deprecating it and will not be further developing it.

For links to work replacing this repository, see the repositories listed at  <http://neelsmith.github.io/greek_language/>.
